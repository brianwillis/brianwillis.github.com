This one has been kicking around on my to-do list for a while now, but I'm glad I finally got to it as part of my end-of-year purge.

Deadlock Empire is a game you can play to learn about locking and parallelisation in C#. If you're a C# developer it's worth your time to give it a shot. I've not worked with the [Barrier Class][1] before, so that was fun to learn about.
