title: Predictions for 2017
---

A short one this year, as we live in uncertain times.

Once again, despite my repeated insistence, one of you went and launched [another social service][1]. I warned you all not to do this, but I suppose it was inevitable that eventually someone would try and open source Twitter. We've had [paid twitter][2], [charity twitter][3], and [gnu twitter][4], so this really is the next logical step. This one is doomed to failure for the same reason as all the others&mdash;social services aren't about features, they're about people, and the people are all using Twitter.

I'm calling it now: the digital crown is coming to the iPhone. It's such a natural interaction on the Apple Watch, would fit perfectly with where you already place your fingers, and could replace the volume up/down buttons in an obvious way.

In other news: Yahoo goes out of business; Google's next Pixel phone becomes a meaningful threat to the iPhone; Apple demonstrates that they still care about the Mac by releasing exemplary Kaby Lake desktops; Microsoft flails in all directions, doing a better job of pleasing developers than paying customers; and you still won't be able to edit a Tweet.

It's traditional for me to wrap this up by predicting that Half Life 3 will come out this year. While I may have started this post calling these "uncertain times", now that we're ten years following the previous chapter's release I think we can say with certainty that the Half Life franchise is well and truly dead.
