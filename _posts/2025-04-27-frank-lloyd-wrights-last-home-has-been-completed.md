I can't begin to tell you how happy this makes me. Even well maintained mid-century modern homes usually look tired after decades of use. To see one that's fresh, and mostly true to the original design (with a few modifications here and there to comply with modern building codes) is indeed a sight to see. All the Wright trademarks are includedâ€”compression and release, natural materials left uncovered by carpet or wallpaper, and of course cement floors in Cherokee Red.

Frank Lloyd Wright died in 1959 and the American landscape is dotted with his homes and high-rises. Usonian homes like this one harken back to Herbert and Katherine Jacobs, who in the 1930's challenged Wright to come up with more modestly priced homes for regular people. There's a [great episode of 99% Invisible][1] about Usonian homes if you're interested in learning all the history.

Now that it's open for use, the River Rock House has [its own website][2] and is available for rent at the completely absurd price of US$1,341 a night. Being so close to the bright lights of Cleveland surely raises the price a bit.
