This project reminds me of the web back in the mid-90's when Yahoo was all the rage. A lot of people remember Yahoo as a search engine, but it began life as an index&mdash;literally a human-compiled list of sites organised by hand. You'd type in your search terms, and each link that you got back would include a one or two sentence description that a Yahoo employee had written.

The 512KB Club is a similarly compiled list, requiring each site to have an uncompressed payload of less than 512KB. The web's become a slow and bloated place, and this sort of thing should be encouraged.

I go back-and-forth on whether this site should keep using Adobe TypeKit and Google Analytics. Is the performance cost really worth it? As time has gone on and more people have started using ad-blockers, including Google Analytics has become increasingly pointless.
