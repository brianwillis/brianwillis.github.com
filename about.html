            <p>I’m Brian Willis. It’s nice to meet you.</p>
            <p>You can get in touch at <a href="mailto:brian@brianwillis.com" title="Send me an email">brian@brianwillis.com</a>. Difficult as it is to believe, email is still my preferred method of communication. Much like democracy, it’s the worst system there is except for all the others that have been tried.</p>
            <p>I’m also on <a href="http://twitter.com/_brianwillis" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100006737536536" title="Facebook">Facebook</a>, and occasionally <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=brianwillis" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a>. When it comes to coding, I use <a href="http://github.com/brianwillis" title="Github">GitHub</a> (with which this site is produced) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/118/brian-willis" title="Stack Overflow">Stack Overflow</a> when I get stuck. I broadcast <a href="https://keybase.io/brianwillis">my public key on Keybase</a> if that’s important to you.</p>
            <p>This site is built using the excellent <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> blogging engine originally written by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a>.
