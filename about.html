            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm Brian Willis. I create software, read books, and write when I can.</p>
            <p>You can find me in a bunch of other places on the web. For commentary, there's a <a href="http://twitter.com/brianfromwgtn" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> account and some inflammatory posts on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=brianwillis" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a>. For coding, there's the awesome <a href="http://github.com/brianwillis" title="Github">GitHub</a> (with which this site is produced) and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/118/brian-willis" title="Stack Overflow">Stack Overflow</a> for when I get stuck.</p>
            <p>If you need to get in touch, I'm available at <a href="mailto:brian@brianwillis.com" title="Send me an email">brian@brianwillis.com</a>.</p>
            <h2>About this site</h2>
            <p>This site is built using the excellent <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> blogging engine originally written by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a>. The whole thing is hosted with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (free of charge I might add, which is awfully kind of them).</p> <p>The fonts come from the good people at <a href="http://typekit.com/">TypeKit</a> (and also the bad people at TypeKit). </p> <p>If you look hard enough you might find some <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> lying around too.
